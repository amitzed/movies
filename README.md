### Technologies Used:
##### AJAX / JSON
##### React JS
##### Ruby on Rails
##### Heroku


#### This simple Movie Information finder was created as a mini-project for GA and demonstrates how to make AJAX requests within REACT.  REACT does not currently have functionality built in to handle AJAX, thus FETCH was used to handle this.
